I run ubuntu as a VM through Hyper-V. To get it working nicely
(tiling wm, enhanced session/rdp) we do the following:

Follow these instructions here:
https://www.nakivo.com/blog/install-ubuntu-20-04-on-hyper-v-with-enhanced-session/

Which boils down to:
- create the VM
- disable secure boot for the VM
- run the ubuntu installation
- ensure 'Log in automatically' is *not* selected
- Run the xrdp install and config script from:
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hinara/linux-vm-tools/ubuntu20-04/ubuntu/22.04/install.sh 
- Enable 'Allow enhanced session mode' in Hyper-V
- In powershell, execute Set-VM -VMName <your_vm_name>  -EnhancedSessionTransportType HvSocket

Now when starting the VM via Hyper-V, display options should appear followed
by an RDP login. You may have to click the Enhanced session icon (2nd from right)
to launch the enhanced session.

To get i3, it's easiest to install regolith: https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/install/

To ensure that regolith is started when connecting via rdp,
create '~/.xsession' and add 'regolith-session'.
