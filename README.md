# dotfiles

dotfiles, scripts etc.

## TODO

- platform setup scripts are outdated
- wm config isn't actually symlinked everywhere, need to work out minimal
  config overrides for sway and i3 (pretty sure all I do is set alt as mod)
  - maybe update and include hardware specific config like monitor config
